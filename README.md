# Java 3D Renderer
This project, based on a school template provided by FIM UHK, was extended by me with the following features:

* Z-buffer visibility algorithm for surfaces
* Linear color interpolation across triangle surfaces
* Custom rasterization of 3D objects
* Camera movement and mouse-controlled view, orthogonal/perspective camera
* Fast view frustum clipping
